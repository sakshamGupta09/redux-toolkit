# Async redux data flow

- In a typical real world application, we never store data only on client layer. We have to communicate with our backend system to read and write data.
- To perform async tasks we use `thunks` which is a middleware.


## Async data flow

- User will interact with the application.
- From event handlers we would now dispatch a `thunk` instead of `actions`.
- This `thunk` will go to a middleware instead of going directly to `store`.
- The middleware performs async task and once the tak is completed, it dispatches an `action` with the data to the store.
- Store then runs the reducer function and updates it's state with the value returned by reducer.
- All the components that are listening to store update receives a notification about state change.


## Data fetching logic pattern

- Before the request, an action is automatically dispatched to store. This is used to know if a request is in progress or not to handle potential loading state or avoid making duplicate calls.
- Actual call happens which will eventually resolve or get rejected.
- Again automatically, actions are dispatched to the store for both success and error cases which will be then handled by a reducer and state of store will be updated.


## createAsyncThunk

```ts
import { createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const fetchItemById = createAsyncThunk(
  'items/fetchItemById',
  async (itemId: string) => {
    const item = await someHttpRequest(itemId)
    return item
  }
)
```

- `createAsyncThunk` accepts a name and a function which has async logic.
- It returns an action creator.


## Typing Redux Thunks


üìÅ src/app/withTypes

```ts
import { createAsyncThunk } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

import type { RootState, AppDispatch } from './store'

export const createAppAsyncThunk = createAsyncThunk.withTypes<{
  state: RootState
  dispatch: AppDispatch
}>()

```



## Loading Posts

- So far we are using some hardcoded data as initial state in `postsSlice`. In a real world application, we would instead read this data from our server using a API call.
- It's also important to keep track of the status of API call. So, we need to change our state structure.


## Loading State for Requests

- The request hasn't started yet
- The request is in progress
- The request succeeded, and we now have the data we need
- The request failed, and there's probably an error message

```ts
{
  // Multiple possible status enum values
  status: 'idle' | 'pending' | 'succeeded' | 'failed',
  error: string | null
  data: Post[]
}
```


## Fetching Data with createAsyncThunk

- Redux Toolkit's createAsyncThunk API generates thunks that automatically dispatch those "start/success/failure" actions for you.

```ts
import { client } from '@/api/client'
import { createAppAsyncThunk } from '@/app/withTypes'

export const fetchPosts = createAppAsyncThunk('posts/fetchPosts', async () => {
  const response = await client.get<Post[]>('/fakeApi/posts')
  return response.data
})
```


## Handling actions

```ts
  extraReducers: builder => {
    builder
      .addCase(userLoggedOut, state => {
        // Clear out the list of posts whenever the user logs out
        return initialState
      })
      .addCase(fetchPosts.pending, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'pending'
      })
      .addCase(fetchPosts.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'succeeded'
        // Add any fetched posts to the array
        state.posts.push(...action.payload)
      })
      .addCase(fetchPosts.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.status = 'failed'
        state.error = action.error.message ?? 'Unknown Error'
      })
  }
})
```
