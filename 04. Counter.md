# Counter example


## 1. Creating the Redux Store

- We should start by creating a store.
- At this time we will not have any `reducers` configured yet, so we can keep the reducer object empty for now.
- The keys of this reducer object will be the same keys present in our final `store` state.
- This tells Redux that we have a feature `state.counter` and only `counterReducer` will decide how to update `state.counter` when `action` is dispatched.

**üìÅ src/app/store.ts**

```ts
import type { Action, ThunkAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
import counterReducer from "@/features/counter/counterSlice"

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
})

// Infer the type of `store`
export type AppStore = typeof store

export type RootState = ReturnType<AppStore["getState"]>

// Infer the `AppDispatch` type from the store itself
export type AppDispatch = AppStore["dispatch"]

// Define a reusable type describing thunk functions
export type AppThunk<ThunkReturnType = void> = ThunkAction<
  ThunkReturnType,
  RootState,
  unknown,
  Action
>

```

üìÅ src/app/hooks.ts

```ts
// This file serves as a central hub for re-exporting pre-typed Redux hooks.
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux"
import type { AppDispatch, RootState } from "./store"

// Use throughout your app instead of plain `useDispatch` and `useSelector`
export const useAppDispatch = useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()
export const useAppSelector = useSelector.withTypes<RootState>()

```


## 2. Redux Slices

- An application may consist of many different features.
- A `Slice` is used to handle only one application feature. For every app feature we will have a corresponsding slice to manage it.
