# Counter example


## 1. Creating the Redux Store

- We should start by creating a store.
- At this time we will not have any `reducers` configured yet, so we can keep the reducer object empty for now.
- The keys of this reducer object will be the same keys present in our final `store` state.
- This tells Redux that we have a feature `state.counter` and only `counterReducer` will decide how to update `state.counter` when `action` is dispatched.

**üìÅ src/app/store.ts**

```ts
import type { Action, ThunkAction } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
import counterReducer from "@/features/counter/counterSlice"

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
})

// Infer the type of `store`
export type AppStore = typeof store

export type RootState = ReturnType<AppStore["getState"]>

// Infer the `AppDispatch` type from the store itself
export type AppDispatch = AppStore["dispatch"]

// Define a reusable type describing thunk functions
export type AppThunk<ThunkReturnType = void> = ThunkAction<
  ThunkReturnType,
  RootState,
  unknown,
  Action
>

```

üìÅ src/app/hooks.ts

```ts
// This file serves as a central hub for re-exporting pre-typed Redux hooks.
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux"
import type { AppDispatch, RootState } from "./store"

// Use throughout your app instead of plain `useDispatch` and `useSelector`
export const useAppDispatch = useDispatch.withTypes<AppDispatch>()
export const useAppSelector = useSelector.withTypes<RootState>()

```


## 2. Redux Slices

- An application may consist of many different features like posts, users, comments etc.
- A `Slice` is used to handle one application feature. For every app feature we will have a dedicated that manages it.
- `Slice` is a collection of `reducer` functions and `actions`.


**üìÅ src/features/counter/counterSlice.ts**


Define the TS type for the feature 

```ts
export interface CounterState {
  value: number
  status: "idle" | "loading" | "failed"
}
```

Define the initial value for the slice state

```ts
const initialState: CounterState = {
  value: 0,
  status: "idle",
}
```

Create a slice using `createSlice` function

- `createSlice` accepts an object as argument which contains `name`, `initialState` and `reducers` object.
- `reducers` object contain key value pair where keys are `action creator` functions and values are `reducer` functions.
- Typical `reducer` function takes two parameters `state` and `action` object. To define type for action's payload we use `PayloadAction<type>` that means the type of payload will be whatever we pass.
- Inside reducer function, we can write mutating logic or return a completely new state.

```ts
// Slices contain Redux reducer logic for updating state, and
// generate actions that can be dispatched to trigger those updates.
export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  // The `reducers` field lets us define reducers and generate associated actions
  reducers: {
    increment: state => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: state => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    // Use the PayloadAction type to declare the contents of `action.payload`
    incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    }
  }
})
```

Export the generated action creators for use in components

```ts
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions
```

Export the slice reducer for use in the store configuration

```ts
export default counterSlice.reducer
```
