## 1. Creating the Store

üìÅ src/app/store.ts

```ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
})
```

## 2. Providing the Store

- It's important that we should not try to directly import the Redux store into other application code files!
