# Redux Terms and Concepts


## State Management

- Global data will reside in one central place outside of the component tree.
- Any component present anywhere in component tree can read this data and triiger updates to this data.
- Specific patterens are followed while reading and updating global data which makes our code predictable.


## Immutability

- Mutable means changeable. Immutable means something cannot be changed.
- React and redux expects that all state updates are done immutably.
- We need to make copies of data from top to the point which we want to change.



## Actions

- User interacts with our application. Actions are used to describe that interaction.
- An action is a plain JavaScript object that has a `type` and an optional `payload` field.
- `Type` field should be a string that gives this action a descriptiove name. Convention is to name it as `feature/eventHappened` in past tense like `todos/todoAdded`.
- `Payload` field contains additional information required to describe the interaction.

```ts
const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'todos/todoAdded',
  payload: 'Buy milk'
}
```


## Action Creators

- A function that creates and returns an action object.
- We typically use these so we don't have to write the action object by hand every time.

```ts
const addTodo = text => {
  return {
    type: 'todos/todoAdded',
    payload: text
  }
}
```


## Reducers

- A reducer is a function that receives `currentState` and `action` object and runs the logic to return a new state.
- `(state, action) => newState`.
- We can think of reducer as an event handler and actions are the events. Some event is trigerred in the application, Reducer please handle it.

### Rules of Reducer

- They should only calculate the new state value based on the `state` and `action` arguments.
- They are not allowed to modify the existing `state.` Instead, they must make immutable updates, by copying the existing `state` and making changes to the copied values.
- They must be `pure` - they cannot do any asynchronous logic, calculate random values, or cause other `side effects`.
