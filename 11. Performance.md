# Render performance

- Whenever our store is updated, the `useSelector` hook will re run the selector function.
- So, it's important that our selector functions do not return a new refreence or value every time they are called.

```ts
export const selectPostsByUser = (state: RootState, userId: string) => {
  const allPosts = selectAllPosts(state)
  // ❌ WRONG - this _always_ creates a new array reference!
  return allPosts.filter(post => post.user === userId)
}
```
- This is wrong because whenever the store changes, the filter function will always return a new reference and hence the component will re render.
- This is sunch a common mistake that we get an error in the console by react-redux if we write selectors that always return different values even for same inputs.



## Memoizing Selector Functions

- We should calculate a new array only if the dependencies of that function have changed like posts or userId.
- This idea is called "memoization". We want to save a previous set of inputs and the calculated result, and if the inputs are the same, return the previous result instead of recalculating it again.
- It would be great if our selector functions are memoized.


## Reselect

- Reselect is a library for creating memoized selector functions.
- It has a `createSelector` function that generates memoized selectors that will only recalculate results when the inputs change.

```ts

export const selectPostsByUser = createSelector(
  // Pass in one or more "input selectors"
  [
    // we can pass in an existing selector function that
    // reads something from the root `state` and returns it
    selectAllPosts,
    // and another function that extracts one of the arguments
    // and passes that onward
    (state: RootState, userId: string) => userId
  ],
  // the output function gets those values as its arguments,
  // and will run when either input value changes
  (posts, userId) => posts.filter(post => post.user === userId)
)
```

- Identify all the dependencies of your selector, posts and userId.
- Write a selector function for each dependency which will take the root state and return some value.
- Finally we write a output function that takes selector output as input and computes a new value.
- When we call `selectPostsByUser(state, userId)`, `createSelector` will pass all of the arguments into each of our input selectors. Whatever those input selectors return becomes the arguments for the output selector.
- If we try calling selectPostsByUser multiple times, it will only re-run the output selector if either posts or userId has changed:
