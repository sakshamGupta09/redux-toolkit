# Async redux data flow

- In a typical real world application, we never store data only on client layer. We have to communicate with our backend system to read and write data.
- To perform async tasks we use `thunks` which is a middleware.


## Async data flow

- User will interact with the application.
- From event handlers we would now dispatch a `thunk` instead of `actions`.
- This `thunk` will go to a middleware instead of going directly to `store`.
- The middleware performs async task and once the tak is completed, it dispatches an `action` with the data to the store.
- Store then runs the reducer function and updates it's state with the value returned by reducer.
- All the components that are listening to store update receives a notification about state change.
