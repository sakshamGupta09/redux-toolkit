# Main Posts Feed


üìÅ src/app/features/posts/postsSlice.ts

## 1. Define the structure of your feature

```ts
export interface IPost {
  id: string
  title: string
  content: string
}
```

## 2. Define the initial value that this feature will have.

```ts
const initialState: IPost[] = [
  { id: '1', title: 'First Post!', content: 'Hello!' },
  { id: '2', title: 'Second Post', content: 'More text' },
]
```

## 3. Create a slice

```ts
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'posts',
  initialState,
  reducers: {},
})
```

## 4. Export action creators and reducer

```ts
export const {} = postsSlice.actions

export default postsSlice.reducer
```

## 5. Define selector functions

```ts
export function selectPosts(state: RootState) {
  return state.posts
}
```

## 6. Add slice's reducer function to store

```ts
import PostsReducer from '@/features/posts/postsSlice'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    posts: PostsReducer,
  },
})
```
- This tells redux that our state object has a property `posts` and that it's data will be managed by `PostsReducer` when any action is dispatched.



## Showing the Posts List

- Now that we have posts data in our store, we can create a component to render posts.
- All posts related features or components will be written inside `posts` folder.
- To render posts, we need to read data from the store. A component can read data from store using `useSelector` hook. The selector function gets automatically called with entire root state as argumeent and it returns the value it needs to read.


üìÅ src/app/features/posts/PostsList.tsx

```tsx
import { useAppSelector } from '@/app/hooks'
import { selectPosts } from './postsSlice'
import PostItem from './PostItem'

export default function PostsList() {
  const posts = useAppSelector(selectPosts)

  const renderedPosts = posts.map((post) => <PostItem key={post.id} post={post} />)

  return (
    <section className="posts-list">
      <h2>Posts</h2>
      {renderedPosts}
    </section>
  )
}

```


## Adding New Posts

- Create a new component `üìÅ src/app/features/posts/AddPostForm.tsx` which will render a form to add a new post.


## Saving Post Entries

- All the logic to update posts data resides in `postsSlice`.
- We need to create an `action` creator and a `reducer` function that will handle the action.
- When we create a reducer function, `createSlice` automatically creates an action creator function for us which we can use to dispatch action objects.

```ts
export const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'posts',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    postAdded(state, action: PayloadAction<IPost>) {
      state.push(action.payload)
    },
  },
})

export const { postAdded } = postsSlice.actions
```

## Dispatching the "Post Added" Action

- Component needs to update store as result of user interaction and only way to do so is by dispatching an action.
- So on submit, we need to `dipatch` `postAdded` action and pass the `post` object to it.
- To use `dispatch` in a component we need to use `useDispatch` hook.
- We would also need to import the action creator and invoke it with a `Post` object.

## nanoid

- This function from redux toolkit generates a random and unique id.
- Use case is our post object payload needs an ID field.


```tsx
import { IPost, postAdded } from './postsSlice'
import { useAppDispatch } from '@/app/hooks'
import { nanoid } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const dispatch = useAppDispatch()

// Create the post object and dispatch the `postAdded` action
const newPost: Post = {
  id: nanoid(),
  title,
  content
}
dispatch(postAdded(newPost))

```


## Showing Single Posts

- First we will create a `PostDetails` component that will be rendered when url is `/posts/123`.
- This component needs to read data from the store. So, we need a selector function and `useSelector` hook.


üìÅ src/app/features/posts/postsSlice.ts

```ts
export function selectPostById(state: RootState, postId: string) {
  return state.posts.find((post) => post.id === postId)
}
```

üìÅ src/app/features/posts/postDetails.tsx

```tsx
const { postId } = useParams()
const post = useAppSelector((state) => selectPostById(state, postId!))

```


## Editing Posts

- We need to add a new component that will take a postId, read the details of that post from store, prefill form data and dispatches an action to store once save is clicked.
- Lets update our slice to add a new reducer function and an action creator so that store knows how to update a post.
- To update store, we first need to find the post that we want to update and then it's title and content. So, the payload field will have 3 pieces of information, ID, title and content.
- The action creator when called with an argument creates an action object with payload value equal to that argument passed.


üìÅ src/app/features/posts/postsSlice.ts

```ts
    postUpdated(state, action: PayloadAction<IPost>) {
      const { id, title, content } = action.payload

      const post = state.find((p) => p.id === id)
      if (post) {
        post.title = title
        post.content = content
      }
    },

export const { postAdded, postUpdated } = postsSlice.actions

```


üìÅ src/app/features/posts/EditPostForm.tsx



## Preparing Action Payloads

- Right now, we're generating the ID and creating the payload object in our React component, and passing the payload object into postAdded.
- But, what if we needed to dispatch the same action from different components, or the logic for preparing the payload is complicated?
- We'd have to duplicate that logic every time we wanted to dispatch the action, and we're forcing the component to know exactly what the payload for this action should look like.
- Reducers should never calculate random values, because that makes the results unpredictable.


- We need a way to customize the contents of `action.payload` before it reaches the store reducer.


## Prepare callback

- We have a prepare callback function. The action dispatched first reaches this middleware. The middlewares customises the payload and returns a new payload. The action then travels to reducer as usual.
- The "prepare callback" function can take multiple arguments, generate random values like unique IDs, and run whatever other synchronous logic is needed to decide what values go into the action object. It should then return an object with the payload field inside.


```ts
const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'posts',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    postAdded: {
      reducer(state, action: PayloadAction<Post>) {
        state.push(action.payload)
      },
      prepare(title: string, content: string) {
        return {
          payload: { id: nanoid(), title, content }
        }
      }
    }
    // other reducers here
  }
})
```
