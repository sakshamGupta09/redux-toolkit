# Redux Terms and Concepts


## State Management

- Global data will reside in one central place outside of the component tree.
- Any component present anywhere in component tree can read this data and triiger updates to this data.
- Specific patterens are followed while reading and updating global data which makes our code predictable.


## Immutability

- Mutable means changeable. Immutable means something cannot be changed.
- React and redux expects that all state updates are done immutably.
- We need to make copies of data from top to the point which we want to change.



## Actions

- User interacts with our application. Actions are used to describe that interaction.
- An action is a plain JavaScript object that has a `type` and an optional `payload` field.
- `Type` field should be a string that gives this action a descriptiove name. Convention is to name it as `feature/eventHappened` in past tense.
