# Counter example


1. Creating the Redux Store

- We should start by creating a store.
- At this time we will nt have any reducers configured yet, so we can keep the reducer object empty for now.

```ts
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
})

```
```ts
// Infer the type of `store`
export type AppStore = typeof store

export type RootState = ReturnType<AppStore['getState']>

// Infer the `AppDispatch` type from the store itself
export type AppDispatch = AppStore['dispatch']

// Define a reusable type describing thunk functions
export type AppThunk<ThunkReturnType = void> = ThunkAction<
  ThunkReturnType,
  RootState,
  unknown,
  Action
>
```
