# Redux Application Data Flow

## Initial Setup

- Application starts.
- A store is created using `configureStore`.
- Store calls the root `reducer` function which returns a new `state`. `Store` saves the returned value as `initial state`.
- UI components read this state from the store and decide what to render.
- They also subscribe to the store. In future whenever the store state changes, Components receive new data and rerender.



## Updates

- User interacts with our application.
- An `action` is `dispatched` to the redux `store`.
- `Store` runs the `reducer` function and saves the new state returned.
- The store notifies all parts of the UI that are subscribed that the store has been updated
- Each UI component that needs data from the store checks to see if the parts of the state they need have changed.
- Each component that sees its data has changed forces a re-render with the new data, so it can update what's shown on the screen.
