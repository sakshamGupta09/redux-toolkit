## Initial Setup

- Application starts.
- A store is created using `configureStore`.
- Store calls the root `reducer` function which returns a new `state`. `Store` saves the returned value as `initial state`.
- UI components read this state from the store and decide what to render.
- They also subscribe to the store. In future whenever the store state changes, Components receive new data and rerender.
