# Redux Terms and Concepts


## State Management

- Global data will reside in one central place outside of the component tree.
- Any component present anywhere in component tree can read this data and triiger updates to this data.
- Specific patterens are followed while reading and updating global data which makes our code predictable.


## Immutability

- Mutable means changeable. Immutable means something cannot be changed.
- React and redux expects that all state updates are done immutably.
- We need to make copies of data from top to the point which we want to change.
