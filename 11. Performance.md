# Render performance

- Whenever our store is updated, the `useSelector` hook will re run the selector function.
- So, it's important that our selector functions do not return a new refreence or value every time they are called.

```ts
export const selectPostsByUser = (state: RootState, userId: string) => {
  const allPosts = selectAllPosts(state)
  // ❌ WRONG - this _always_ creates a new array reference!
  return allPosts.filter(post => post.user === userId)
}
```
- This is wrong because whenever the store changes, the filter function will always return a new reference and hence the component will re render.
- This is sunch a common mistake that we get an error in the console by react-redux if we write selectors that always return different values even for same inputs.
