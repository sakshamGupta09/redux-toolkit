# Adding an Auth Slice

📁 src/app/features/auth/authSlice.ts

## 1. Define the structure of auth slice

```ts
export interface IAuthState {
  userId: string | null
}
```

## 2. Define the initial value of auth slice

```ts
const initialState: IAuthState = {
  userId: null,
}
```

## 3. Create auth slice

```ts
const authSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'auth',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    login(state, action: PayloadAction<string>) {
      state.userId = action.payload
    },
    logout(state) {
      state.userId = null
    },
  },
})

```

## 4. Export the reducer and action creators

```ts
export const { login, logout } = authSlice.actions

export default authSlice.reducer
```

## 5. Define slectors

```
export function selectCurrentUser(state: RootState) {
  return state.auth.userId
}
```

## 6. Update store to add user reducer

```ts
export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    auth: AuthReducer,
    posts: PostsReducer,
    users: UsersReducer,
  },
})
```


## Handling Actions in Multiple Slices

- Whenever we want to update state, we write a reducer function and export action creator. UI then dispatches that action to the store.
- But sometimes, we want to update multiple features, in response to a action. Example on logout, I want to clear auth state and posts state.
- We can dispatch two actions one after the other but that is a bad practice.
- I want that multiple slices can listen to an action dispatched.


## Using extraReducers to Handle Other Actions

- Using `extraReducers` option, we can listen to actions that were defined elsewhere.
- Many different slice reducers can all respond to the same dispatched action, and each slice can update its own state if needed!


📁 src/app/features/posts/postsSlice.ts


```ts
import { userLoggedOut } from '@/features/auth/authSlice'

  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    // Pass the action creator to `builder.addCase()`
    builder.addCase(userLoggedOut, (state) => {
      // Clear out the list of posts whenever the user logs out
      return []
    })
  },
```
